# HealthCare_Failure_Prediction_Dashboard(Tableau Dashboard)

üè• Overview
The "HealthCare Failure Prediction Dashboard" is a comprehensive data visualization project created with Tableau to address critical issues within the healthcare sector. By analyzing a rich dataset, this dashboard provides key insights and predictive analytics that can help healthcare professionals, administrators, and researchers anticipate potential failures and make data-driven decisions to enhance patient care and operational efficiency. The dashboard focuses on transforming raw data into actionable insights, making complex healthcare trends easy to understand and act upon.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard features dynamic charts, graphs, and filters that allow users to explore data from different perspectives.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): It highlights crucial metrics related to patient outcomes, resource utilization, and potential risks.
Predictive Insights: The visualizations are designed to reveal patterns and correlations that can be used to predict future trends, such as patient readmission or other healthcare failures.
User-Friendly Interface: The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences, from data analysts to hospital managers.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project was built using the following technologies:
Tableau: The primary tool used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive analysis.
Data Source: The dashboard is powered by a structured healthcare dataset (likely a CSV, Excel, or database connection).

üìä Dataset
The project utilizes a structured dataset containing a wide range of healthcare variables, including:
Patient demographics
Clinical data (diagnoses, lab results, medications)
Encounter details (admission type, length of stay)
Hospital and provider information

The data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared within Tableau to enable effective visualization and analysis.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to View
The "HealthCare Failure Prediction Dashboard" is hosted on Tableau Public and can be viewed directly through a web browser. No installation is required.

üìà Dashboard Analysis & Insights
The dashboard offers several interactive views to analyze healthcare data. You can filter data by various dimensions to explore specific patient segments or trends.
Key Charts to Highlight:
Patient Readmission vs. Length of Stay: A scatter plot or bar chart showing the relationship between a patient's time in the hospital and their likelihood of readmission.
Medication Distribution: A tree map or bar chart showing the most frequently prescribed medications and their correlation with patient outcomes.
Risk Score Heatmap: A heatmap that visualizes patient failure risk across different demographics or clinical groups.
